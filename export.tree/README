This sedation, ischemia, recovery experiment contains 11 animals (juvenile pigs).

Animals were surgically instrumented, and then monitored under sedation states 1-5 (isoflurane, fentanyl, propofol), followed by 1 or 2 episodes of gradual ischemia (states 6 and 8) and recovery (recovery 1 = state 7, between state 6 and 8; recovery 2, after state 8, corresponding to states 9-12).

Two crude groups are indicated: 
1) sedation - animals had no ischemia and 
2) ischemia - animals had sedation, followed by ischemia episodes and followed by recovery.

The scientific article (see Reference) contains all methodological details.
